<p>This is my final project. The requirements consists of building a website, using FlexBox and having at least one page. This class was definitely a great experience as I am able to learn as I ran into errors. It reminds me of back when I learned everything by reading different codes that were available on the Internet. The pace was great as some weeks were easier than others, which allowed you to continue to fix the errors you run into before going to the next assignment. I would highly recommend this method of teaching when it comes to Web Development. <a href="#home">Go back up.</a></p></main>
